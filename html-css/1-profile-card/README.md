# Profile card component

![Design preview for the Profile card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**To do this exercise, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this profile card component and get it looking **as close to the design as possible**.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
2. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
3. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
4. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Steps for running the project
1. Open VS Code and install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
2. Follow the instructions present in the Live Server extension on how to spin up a live server.
3. Start the live server for the project and start coding.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€

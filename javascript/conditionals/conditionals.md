# Conditionals

1. Write a condition that returns true for `==` but not `===` and explain why.
2. Write a single `if` condition that returns true if x is greater than or equal to 10 and is even, or if x is less than 10 and is odd.
3. Use a ternary operator to assign `'odd'` or `'even'` to a variable called `'output'` by checking if a variable `'x'` is odd or even
4. Using `if/else if/else` write a program that takes an input `x (1-7)` and prints corresponding weekday (1-Sunday etc).  If input is invalid print invalid input.
5. Solve question 4 using switch case.

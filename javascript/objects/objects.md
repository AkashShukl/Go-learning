# Objects

1. Write a function which takes an object as input and print out its properties
2. How to delete property `'a'` from object
    ```javascript
    x = {'a':1,'b':2}
    ```
3. Given `x = {a:'1'}; y = x;` does changing y.a change x.a? Why?
4. Copy `x = {'a':1}` to a variable `y` without creating a reference to `x`.
5. Write a function to check if two objects are equal.
